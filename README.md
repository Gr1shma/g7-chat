**g7-chat** is *your* AI chat interface. No fluff. No nonsense. Just raw power behind a keyboard. Built to be fast, clean, and yours. It's like yet another AI chat wrapper â€” but stripped down, self-owned, and unapologetically efficient.

## Running Locally

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and drop in your secrets â€” no excuses.
2. Run `pnpm install` â€” lock down your dependencies like you own this machine.
3. Run `pnpm dev` â€” fire up the server and take control.

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start breaking the systemâ€¦ or building something better.
